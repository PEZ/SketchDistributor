Sketch plugin that distributes selected objects vertically or horizontally *with a specified spacing*.

Like so:

## Installation

I recommend using [Sketch Toolbox](http://sketchtoolbox.com), but you can also download and unpack the [zip archive](https://github.com/PEZ/SketchDistributor/archive/master.zip) and then open `Distributor.sketchplugin`, Sketch will open it up and install the plugin for you. 

## How-to

You select the objects you want to distribute, then ask Distributor to do it. There are two ”modes”:

1. *Distribute...* (`Shift + Control + D`) brings up a dialog box. You choose direction (vertically or horizontally) and spacing (in pixels).
1. *Distribute again* (`Shift + Control + A`) applies the last used distribution settings on the selected objects.

Note that you can use negative spacing to get overlap. Like so (spacing: -14):
